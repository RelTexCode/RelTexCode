- Hello! I am Soltice, a Discord & Roblox Game and Bot Developer.

## How my Programming Life Started
One day back in 2018, I was interested in making games, so I started learning programming in Tynker. Which has not been really good. So I decided, by the next year
i'll start more of a better way of programming, with typing.
